# Small Basic Challenges

This projet is some research for un concept of Small Basic Challenge between two Players.

## Concept

The purpose is to provide some challenges (or games) where two players create a Small Basic program which need to win the challenge or his opponent.

The communication system need to be very simple because Small Basic don't have High Level communication features, and need work without extensions.

This is not a real time communication system, only game that can be work turn-by-turn should supported.

The process :

- Each program try to connect the system
- When it's connected, the challenge start
- While the challenge is running the progam play
